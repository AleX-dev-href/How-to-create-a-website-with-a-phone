<h2>This website was actually made with a phone and i will show you how to create one too!<h2>
<br>
<h3>How to code a website with your phone</h3>
<p>•First of all, you will need an app, where you can code a <strong>html</strong> code</p>
<p>The two apps that work the best are <strong>TrebEdit </strong>and<strong> Acode</strong></p>
<br>
<p>•Then create a file named <strong>index.html</strong> and start coding your website</p>
<p>You can learn how to code from Apps or Youtube</p> 
<p>I used to learn <strong>html</strong> with <strong>TrebEdit</strong></p>
<br>
<h3>•Upload your website</h3>
<p>if you want your website to be publicly accesible, use: <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, <strong>Netlify</strong> or <strong>Google Drive hosting</strong></p>
<br>
<h2>Congratulations! You officially coded a website!</h2>
<br>
<h3>If you can't code, here are some <strong>links</strong>  you can use to make your own website, without scripting any code:<h3>
