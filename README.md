How to code a website with your phone

•First of all, you will need an app, where you can code a html code

The two apps that work the best are TrebEdit and Acode


•Then create a file named index.html and start coding your website

You can learn how to code from Apps or Youtube

I used to learn html with TrebEdit


•Upload your website
if you want your website to be publicly accesible, use: GitHub Pages, Netlify or Google Drive hosting


Congratulations! You officially coded a website!

If you can't code, here are some links you can use to make your own website, without scripting any code:

www.Wix.com

www.Webflow.com

www.Framer.com
